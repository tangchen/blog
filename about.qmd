Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am currently a PhD candidate at the [School of Labor and Employment Relations, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ler.illinois.edu/). My advisor is [Dr. Daniel A. Newman](https://ler.illinois.edu/directory/1003/). I am also an affiliated doctoral researcher at [Purdue Recruitment and Selection Research Lab](http://qchelseasong.com/) led by [Dr. Q. Chelsea Song](https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/chelsea-song/).

My research interests are People Analytics and other topics related to Human Resources and Organizational Behavior. For more information about me, please see my CV \[here\](https://tangc.net/cv.html).

## Please note...

This website is actually my personal notebook. It contains stuff that I'm working on, or some pieces of information that I find interesting or important. They are very unstructured and probably contain a lot of errors/typos/thoughtos. ;o)
