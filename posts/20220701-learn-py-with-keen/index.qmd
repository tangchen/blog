My older son, Keen, is six years old now and he's getting interested in coding. So I'm now working on a series of Jupyter notebooks that introduce him to Python.

Although I'm more of an R user, I feel Python is a better language to start for kids.

(Thanks to the `reticulate` package, I am able to write and run Python code within RStudio. Mad respect to whoever developed this package!)

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

## Session 1: Python Basics

### 1. Numbers

#### 1.1. Using Python as a calculator

```{python}
1 + 5
```

```{python}
538687445 + 3897886465
```

```{python}
6 - 3
```

```{python}
30 - 8
```

#### 1.2. Variables

The equals sign ("=") means assignment, e.g., $x = 1$ gives the value $1$ to variable $x$.

```{python}
1 + 5
```

```{python}
x = 1
y = 5

x + y
```

```{python}
x = 3

x + y
```

```{python}
z = x - y
z
```

**Your turn:** - Create two variables: a and b. Assign 5 to a, and 10 to b - Calculate the sum of a and b, save it to a third variable called c - Calculate $a \times b$ (hint: In Python, the multiplication sign is "\*" \[asterisk\]) - Calculate $a \div b$ (The division sign is "/" \[forward slash\])

```{python}
a = 5
b = 10
```

```{python}
c = a + b
```

```{python}
a * b
```

```{python}
a / b
```

**Mini Project:**

Calculate $1 + 2 + ... + 10$.

Hint:

$$1 + 2 + ... + k = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}$$

(Why?)

```{r}
# step 1: determine k
k = 10

# step 2: write the equation
k * (k + 1) / 2
```

```{python}
# defining a function to take any k value
def calc_sum(k):
   s = k * (k + 1) / 2 
   return s

calc_sum(k = 1_000_000)
```

#### 1.3 Strings

```{python}
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "Keen"

print(s1)
```

```{python}
print(s2)
```

```{python}
print(s1 + s2)
```

```{python}
print(s1 + ", " + s2)
```

```{python}
print(s1 + ", " + s2 + "!")
```

```{python}
print("H" + s1[1:5] + ", " + s2 + "!")
```

```{python}
a1 = "4"
b5 = "14"

a1 + b5
```

**Project:**

```{python}
# tell me about you
name = "huijing"
age = 19

print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
```

```{python}
name

"H" + name[1:]
```

#### 1.4 Lists

```{python}
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "peach"]
keen = [2, 4, 1]
mom = [0, 1, 3]
```

```{python}
# how many bananas did Keen eat this week?
print("Keen ate " + str(keen[1]) + " bananas this week.")
```

```{python}
# How many peaches did mon eat this week?
print("Mom ate " + str(mom[2]) + " peaches this week.")
```

```{python}
# How many bananas were eaten in total?
print("In total, " + str(keen[1] + mom[1]) + " were eaten this week")
```
